# Device Synchronization Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the secure P2P device synchronization feature for Q-Safe Vault.

## Problem Statement
Users needed a way to sync their password vault between devices (Windows, Linux, Android) when both devices are online, without using cloud services, while maintaining strict security and production-grade code quality.

## Solution
Implemented a secure peer-to-peer (P2P) synchronization protocol using:
- Direct local network connections
- End-to-end encryption
- Device pairing with verification codes
- Automatic conflict resolution

## Architecture

### Components
1. **SyncService** (`lib/services/sync_service.dart`)
   - Core synchronization protocol
   - Handles server and client roles
   - Manages encryption and key exchange
   - Implements security measures

2. **SyncDialog** (`lib/widgets/sync_dialog.dart`)
   - User interface for sync process
   - Guides users through pairing
   - Displays connection status
   - Shows PIN and IP addresses

3. **HomePage Integration** (`lib/pages/home_page.dart`)
   - Sync button in toolbar
   - Entry merge logic
   - Error handling

## Security Implementation

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Key Exchange**: X25519 (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)
  - Ephemeral key pairs generated per session
  - Never stored on disk
  - 32-byte public keys

- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM
  - Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
  - Random nonces per encryption
  - Integrity protection via MAC

- **PIN Verification**: HMAC-SHA256
  - 6-digit random PIN
  - Hashed with shared secret
  - Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks

### Security Features
1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Maximum 3 PIN attempts per connection
   - Local counter per connection (thread-safe)
   - Connection blocked after max attempts

2. **Input Validation**
   - PIN: Must be exactly 6 numeric digits
   - Address: Cannot be empty
   - Public Key: Must be exactly 32 bytes

3. **Timeout Protection**
   - 5-minute session timeout
   - Automatic cleanup on timeout
   - Prevents indefinite exposure

4. **Network Isolation**
   - Local network only (port 48923)
   - No internet/cloud communication
   - No intermediate servers

5. **Data Integrity**
   - AEAD MAC verification
   - Message length validation
   - 100MB size limit for vault data

## Protocol Flow

### Server (Receiving Device)
1. Bind to port 48923 on all interfaces
2. Generate random 6-digit PIN
3. Display PIN and IP addresses to user
4. Wait for connection (with timeout)
5. Perform ECDH key exchange
6. Verify PIN from client
7. Receive encrypted vault data
8. Decrypt and merge with existing entries
9. Save merged vault

### Client (Sending Device)
1. User enters server IP and PIN
2. Validate inputs
3. Connect to server
4. Perform ECDH key exchange
5. Send PIN hash for verification
6. Encrypt and send vault data
7. Wait for confirmation
8. Close connection

### Handshake Protocol
```
Client                          Server
  |                               |
  |------- TCP Connect ---------> |
  |                               |
  | <----- Server Hello --------- |
  |      (public key)             |
  |                               |
  | ------ Client Hello --------> |
  |  (public key + PIN hash)      |
  |                               |
  | <----- Verify OK/Error ------ |
  |                               |
  | ----- Encrypted Vault ------> |
  |                               |
  | <----- Close --------------- |
```

## Merge Strategy
- Entries identified by unique ID
- Map-based deduplication
- Received entries take precedence
- New entries from both devices added
- User notified of merge completion
